I am a Computer Science student in Purdue University’s accelerated BS/MS program. Currently in my final year of the Bachelor’s and first year of the Master’s, I am on track to complete both degrees within four years. My main interest lies in theoretical computer science, particularly in the areas computaional topology and geometry.
