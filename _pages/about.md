I am a Computer Science student in Purdue University’s accelerated BS/MS program, specializing in Machine Learning. Currently in my final year of the Bachelor’s and first year of the Master’s, I am on track to complete both degrees within four years.

I am interested in theoretical computer science, particularly in the areas computaional topology and geometry, as well as machine learning. Additionally, I have recently developed an interest in computer graphics, particularly in the simulation of dynamic elements like water and cloth, an area I am excited to explore further.
