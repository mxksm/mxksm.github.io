<a href="/files/project_report.pdf" rel="permalink"> Ensemble Methods Survey </a>
</h2></article></div>

This project involved conducting a survey on ensemble methods as part of my graduate class. I discuss Random Forests, AdaBoost, and XGBoost, and test their performance on multiple datasets. The report includes a detailed analysis of the results and a comparison of the three ensemble methods.

<a> ML Projects </a>
</h2></article></div>

Though I have not created a repository for this yet, I have worked on implementing various machine learning algorithms and projects over the last few months. These projects include implementing transformers, convolutional neural networks, neural networks, boosted decision trees and more.

</h2></article></div>

This project implements simulations to compare the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation methods for estimating the bias of a coin based on toss results. The project uses Python for both the calculation of estimations and the visualization of results.

</h2></article></div>

The Purdue Housing Bot is a specialized Discord bot designed to assist Purdue University students in finding available on-campus housing. Utilizing web scraping techniques, this bot provides real-time updates on available dorms and apartments, significantly simplifying the housing search process. This bot was instrumental in helping me and my friends secure on-campus housing, avoiding the need for more expensive off-campus alternatives.

<a href="https://github.com/maxinimus/LaTeX-Matrix-Calculator" rel="permalink"> Latex Matrix Calculator </a>
</h2></article></div>

This is one of my first few projects. It is a simple matrix calculator that accepts latex code of a matrix as input and finds various properties of the matrix such as determinant, inverse, etc, useful if you are doing homework in LaTeX and need to find the inverse of a matrix quickly. It is built using the React framework for the frontend and Flask framework for the backend.
